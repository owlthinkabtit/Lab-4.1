## Reflection Questions
1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

I apprached it like math word problems are written, you know like "If Johnny has 6 apples..." type of questions. Figuring out what was being asked of me, and trying to translate that into a function. 

I didn't run into any challenges, to me it's like if you say "If we're only looking for women in xAge bracket, the fuction choses it. If not, it is denied." My logical brain comes in handy!

Taking exisiting code and being able to resue it for multpile tasks...I would think that's how refacting improves code. Example is that last function that takes the shopping cart, but also gives you the ability to add a discount.
